      <h1> Pricing </h1>
      <p> Prices vary based on how long the employee is going to be watching the dog and to what extent. Prices also vary on where the customer lives and what they want me to be doing at they houses. Stay has had customers in the past that has left money to pick up pet supplies, or to take their dog to the groomer. Doing customers errands for them often causes the price to increase. Currently Stay charges $50 a night or $15 an hour. The price can vary depending on the customer and how much they are willing to pay, some customers will only pay $30 a night and we will accept that. An employee could have a set cost of $30 to $50 a day, or a set cost per week. It all depends on the employee and what they want their rate to be and also how many pets they plan on sitting in a week. </p>
